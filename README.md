# Octal Foundry 🚀

**Bridging the gap between university theory and career-ready skills.**

Octal Foundry is a student-built platform designed to transform university education in Kenya and Africa. We take the theoretical knowledge students gain in university and complement it with structured, AI-powered learning roadmaps that build practical, job-ready skills.

Built by students, for students. 🇰🇪

## 🌟 Mission

**To make every Kenyan student career-ready by graduation—no bootcamp, no debt, no wasted holidays.**

We believe university education provides a strong foundation, but there is a disconnect with industry needs. Octal Foundry bridges this gap by providing:
- **Curated Learning Paths:** Structured roadmaps aligned with real-world careers.
- **Practical Projects:** Learning by doing, not just watching tutorials.
- **Community Support:** A network of peers, mentors, and developers.

## ✨ Features

- **AI-Powered Roadmaps:** Turn your university syllabus into a practical skill tree.

  - **For Students:** Free, high-quality learning resources and career guidance.
  - **For Companies:** Access to a pool of disciplined, skilled graduates.
- **Community Driven:** Built open-source by a community of passionate student developers.
